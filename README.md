Milliammeter with High Precision using a Reference Instrument and Linear Regression

This project was developed using the PIC12F685, but it can be implemented with any other microcontroller by applying the same concepts and techniques.

## Steps to Develop This Project

### 1. Implement the Non-inverting Amplifier:

Implement the non-inverting amplifier with a gain of approximately 10 or 12 times the input voltage (for the measurement range used).

### 2. Use a Milliammeter as a Reference Instrument:

Use a milliammeter as a reference instrument and take two measurements: current in the shunt resistor with the milliammeter, and read ADC value in the microcontroller.

3. Get the Equation of the Line:

Get the equation of the line using the method of least squares or with the Excel tool.

4. Program the Microcontroller:

Put the obtained equation in the microcontroller and program it, adding a display to visualize the measurement in mA.

5. Verify the Measurements (Optional):

Compare the measurements between the reference instrument and the value on the display in your circuit to verify the measurements.
